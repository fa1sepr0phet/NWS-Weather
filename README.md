##  Philosophy

Weather is public information.

Many modern weather platforms rely on ads, subscriptions, and user tracking. This project is a small step in the opposite direction—keeping weather simple, transparent, and accessible.

- No ads  
- No analytics or tracking  
- No subscriptions  
- No paywalls  
- No data harvesting  

**Just weather.**

## Philosophy on Usage

This project is released under the MIT License to encourage openness and collaboration.

However, the intent of this project is to keep weather information free, accessible, and free from monetization.

If you use this code, please respect that spirit:
- avoid adding ads or tracking
- avoid restricting access behind paywalls

This is not a legal requirement, but a request to preserve the purpose of the project.
