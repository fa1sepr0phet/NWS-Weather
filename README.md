## Network Requests

JustWeather makes network requests only for weather and location functionality.

Primary service:

- `api.weather.gov` — National Weather Service weather forecast data

Possible system-level service:

- Android `Geocoder` — used for address lookup; the backend may depend on the device, Android version, or OEM.

JustWeather does not send data to analytics, advertising, crash-reporting, or tracking services.
